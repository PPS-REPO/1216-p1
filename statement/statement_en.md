# Problem

Sumin and Minsu are arguing about whether the string "Sumin" or the string "Minsu" appears more frequently in a given string $S$.

To avoid the argument from escalating, Sungwon wants to create a program that determines whether "Sumin" or "Minsu" appears more often in the string $S$. However, Sungwonâ€™s programming skills are poor, so you need to write the program for him.

Help Sungwon by writing a program that determines which of the two substrings appears more frequently in $S$.

# Input

The first line contains a string $S$.
* $1 \le |S| \le 100$

# Output

Print "Sumin" if the string "Sumin" appears more frequently in $S$, or "Minsu" if "Minsu" appears more frequently.
